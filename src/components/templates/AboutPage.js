					Yo! Welcome to my website!
					<br />
					I'm a photographer, wanderer, and a software engineer.
					I was born in Cambodia and was adopted at age 1. I've spent most of my
					growing up days on a small ranch in Montana. I love to travel, meet people, and explore the outdoors... rest to be continued!

							<strong>Photographer</strong>
						</h2>
						<p>
							What kind of photography do I do? Well, I do all types varying from landscape, portraits, engagement and graduation sessions to aerial shots! I've also dabbled in videography and Davinci Resolve editing software.
						</p>
						<p>
							I first got into photography when I received a digital Kodak camera for my 11th birthday, which then sat in my dresser for a year... Nevertheless, over the years I've been slowly adding the different niches of photography to my skillset.
						</p>
						<p>
							June 2010 is when I first picked up a camera and started doing landscape. August 2016, I started dabbling in astrophotography (probably my favorite). July 2020, I started doing more portrait and engagement shoots. My latest interest  since July 2021 has been flying my drone videoing and capturing photos from up above.
						</p>
						<p>
							Even though I've been doing photography for 12 plus years, there's always something new and exciting to learn! Usually how life works.

							<strong>Software Engineer</strong>
						</h2>
						<p>
							I'm a Software Engineer specialized in Full-Stack Web Development with 3 years of experience in the industry. I currently work at {<ActionLink href="https://www.economicmodeling.com/" classes="blue" target="_blank">Emsi Burning Glass</ActionLink>} located here in Moscow, Idaho.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since I was about 8 years old, I had dreams of becoming an engineer. Since childhood, I loved solving problems, brain teaser puzzles, creating things with my hands, and of course math being my favorite subject in school. Ironically, I rarely use math at my current job ðŸ˜‚.
						</p>
						<p>
							The things I appreciate about software engineering is the creativity, the critical thinking, and the fact you can build anything at the tips of your fingertips! With me being a visual person in general, building things and having that instantaneous feedback is my cup of tea.

							<strong>Life</strong>
						</h2>
						<p>
							My name is Peter and I like to party.
							Outside of work and photography, I love learning new things and going out of my comfort zone which caused me to have a lot of different hobbies and interests. Basically, I enjoy anything that involves the outdoors!
						</p>
						<p>
							Since I grew up in Montana, some of my hobbies/interests include hunting and fishing, hiking and camping (aka feeding the Mosquitoes), shooting guns and archery, skiing, dirtbiking, or playing with a can of gasoline and matches... because that's how you entertain country kids... Anyways, let's forget I said that. I also enjoy playing sports to pass time such as ultimate frisbee, spikeball, volleyball, soccer, disc golf, or martial arts.
						</p>
						<p>
							To end, I want to give credit to God for giving me the talents and gifts I have. And of course, thankful for my parents for supporting, encouarging, and pushing me in life. It hasn't been the easiest but who said the Christian faith was suppose to be easy?
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p className="mt-3 no-indentation">
							"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."
